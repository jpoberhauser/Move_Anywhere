A topic model is created by factorizing an overall document/word matrix into separate document/word - topic/word matrices.  Extensive validation/ideal topic number & word number were carried out to ensure that enough/not too many topics are returned/matched given a previous click.  The ultimate utilization would be for a single city or cross-city matching environment."
