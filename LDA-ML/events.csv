These educational courses are the very basis for every aesthetics practice.
Overview: The Botox Training workshop is very complete and all inclusive and created so that you can immediately begin performing these techniques on your own. The general format of the workshop is to receive very detailed lectures in the morning followed by intensive hands on training in the afternoon.
The workshop gives you the opportunity to use real Botulinum Toxin products on actual live volunteers. In fact, a good percentage of your tuition is used to purchase these supplies as well as all the medicines you will be using. Attendees are also welcome to bring along a friend or companion if you choose to use them for your injections. (Why not, they are receiving FREE injections. We never charge our volunteers).
Workshop Topics: You will learn all the protocols associated with each of the Botulinum Toxin Type A products such as Botox Cosmetic as well as the newer, highly effective Xeomin and Dysport products. To operate a successful aesthetic practice it is important to know about and be able to utilize the different products your patients may ask for. Each will be available and used during the hands on portion of the class so you can decide on your own which Botulinum product will best suit your practice objectives.

Comprehensive Training and Certification: This is a certification program intended only for Physicians and qualified health care practitioners. After completion of the course and demonstration of proficiency, you will receive your certification and course certificate. Attendees also have the option to receive their certificate framed in an attractive wood and metal plaque.

12,"Sclerotherapy Training - New York, NY","New+York,+NY","Improved techniques, new, safer sclerosing agents, and high patient demand for in-office aesthetic procedures makes Sclerotherapy Training for nurses and physicians a must for any physician practice wishing to expand their services. Over 80 million Americans suffer with unsightly venous disease and the vast majority (75%) of these is cosmetic in nature which you will understand and be able to treat after completing our training.
Visible veins give the impression of age and poor health and though many people wish to receive treatment, they are unaware of the safety, effectiveness, and lack of discomfort associated with newer sclerotherapy methods. Sclerotherapy by injection uses small amounts of detergent solutions to irritate the vein walls and achieve ultimate closure of the unwanted vein.  
Cosmetic laser centers and vein clinics perform these procedures not only because they are lucrative and simple to perform, but also because their patients receive impressive results using both laser vein therapies and traditional sclerotherapy using FDA approved detergent sclerosants.  Our comprehensive sclerotherapy training will take you from the prospective patient through the consultation process as well as teach you the latest techniques and protocols used today.

18,"Reconciling Biomechanics with Pain Science - New York, NY","New+York,+NY","Course Description
At its simplest, this is a BIOMECHANICS and PAIN SCIENCE course.  Ideally, we've distilled the best of both to get the best approach to pain and injury management.
Reconciling Biomechanics with Pain Science is a two-day course that mixes a lecture, case study and hands-on learning format. This course has been taught throughout the world with the aim of simplifying the biomechanical approach to injury and pain management.  A simplified, yet strongly evidenced based biomechanical approach, allows the therapist to develop skills that address all areas of the biopsychosocial contributors to the pain experience.  This course teaches When Biomechanics Matters and fits this approach into Therapeutic Neuroscience Education framework.
Traditional rehabilitation practice is steeped in the biomedical model of treating pain and injuries.  While the biopyschosocial model of care is touted as being the superior approach it is often difficult to incorporate traditional biomechanical training within this model.  There is the fear that therapists become psychotherapists.  The aim of this course is to help reconcile and reconceptualize the biomechanical approach.  You will learn that you need not throw the baby out with the bath water when you embrace the biopsychosocial (BPS) approach.  Remember, the BPS model starts with ""Bio"": you will learn how biomechanics matters and how pain science education and cognition changing can fit together.
This course is great for anyone working with people in pain or injuries.  Physiotherapists, Chiros, Massage Therapists , Osteopaths, Sport Therapists, Movement Pros/Teachers and Strength Coaches are welcome.

The Evolution of Primary Care
For our May show, the Evolution of Medicine is thrilled to be heading to Minnesota, MN for the first time, the site of the largest Functional Forum meetup to date. So far in 2017, we have focused each episode on medical specialties, where the functional medicine operating system could be beneficial in going upstream and solving the root causes of those disease categories.
Primary Care, however, is where we believe is the rightful place for functional medicine not only for the best clinical outcomes, but also for the positive economic impact for payers and patients alike. During the episode we will not only be looking at the clinical models, but also evolved delivery models including micropractices, membership models and episodes of care.
Furthermore, the Evolution of Primary Care is about all different professions coming together to serve patients on the front lines, helping people create and maintain health. To this end, we'll be featuring a variety of guests from across the professions set to this evolution.
Featured in this episode are leaders in the space who are already bringing functional medicine to the masses. First we welcome, Dr. Thomas Sult who brings decades of experience treating tough cases. He's on the faculty at the Institute for Functional Medicine and will be sharing insight from his clinic ""Third Opinion"".
We are thrilled to welcome Dr. Kristi Hughes for her Functional Forum debut. Dr. Hughes is one of the most popular educators with the Institute for Functional Medicine and has a successful functional medicine practice. She be sharing a mix of clinical and practical pearls about operating a functional medicine practice on the front lines.
We're also very excited to welcome Dr. Sachin Patel of the Living Proof Institute as our other keynote speaker. Dr. Patel is running of one of the most innovative practices functional medicine in North America. His Living Proof Institute is expanding rapidly. Dr. Patel has been innovating the group structure, marketing, and patient acquisition. We're very excited to share his vison of the future of primary care.
Also, joining this group of practitioners is journalist, Pilar Garsimo, founding editor of Experience Life magazine who has been covering the emergence of functional medicine for more than a decade.
Featured Speakers:
Thomas Sult, MD Kristi Hughes, ND Sachin Patel, DC Pilar Gerasimo

 Why attend a meetup?
One of the biggest frustrations we hear from practitioners who practice the type of medicine that you do, is that you feel isolated from the rest of their medical community who don’t “get” the true value of what you offer. The purpose of the Functional Forum local meetup groups is to help you to develop a community of practitioners in your area who “get it”, to build your referral network, add value to your practice, your community, and the movement at large.
Anyone can tune into our Functional Forum event via livestream. What really excites us is when our events create dialogue between practitioners that are sharing best practices, asking tough questions, and helping each other to create the greatest impact with their patients and communities. It gives you the opportunity to not only network but also, keep your finger on the pulse of what’s happening in your own healthcare community.

29,"Cynefin & Complexity Foundations - New York City, NY","New+York,+NY","In today’s increasingly volatile and uncertain world, there is a need  for new ways of making sense of current situations and managing in new and rapidly shifting contexts. Our past practices and approaches are failing us and what had worked reliably during more stable times in the past is unfortunately proving inadequate for the dynamic present. This course challenges the deeply rooted thinking patterns that have been ingrained by years of conventional thinking.
Take a dive into complexity theory, and the practical implications for operating in a world of inherent uncertainty.  Learn about the Cynefin framework – and how to apply it in organisations; how to make better decisions, dependent on the situation; cognitive neuroscience – and how it can shape how we build and communicate in organisations.

What it’s about:
Complexity has become a buzzword for the world we work within - this course provides you with the foundational tools to understand what it means to act and manage in complexity.
Cynefin and Complexity Foundations forms the core component of Cognitive Edge's training offerings. It contributes to building the basic scaffolds around which further anthro-complexity (also referred to as “cognitive complexity”) approaches and concepts are constructed, and form a key sense-making toolkit for working in complex environments. 

Who it is for:
This course designed for people who work in constantly-evolving, dynamic situations, dealing daily with uncertainty and risk, and looking for a enhanced compass for building organisations that are both resilient and innovative. Whether you work in an organisation navigating intractable problems, or are a consultant looking to include complexity principles into your practice - or if you are simply complexity-curious - this Foundations class is for you.

What we will cover:
This has been designed as a 3-day session - a combination of deep immersion into Anthro-complexity, and introduction to working with the Cynefin framework, to complete the Foundations level sessions.
The session will begin with an introduction to complexity, and the natural and human science that sit behind the naturalising tradition of anthro-complexity. Discover and manage the evolutionary potential of the present by increasing situational awareness of the types of systems that we sit within, and how to modulate within complex systems.
The Cynefin framework has subtleties and nuances which are not easily accessible to the casual reader. Building on the basics of anthro-complexity, and the Harvard Business Review article, the third day goes deeper into the uses of the framework, accompanied by facilitated workshop activities and tools that have been used in organisations as diverse as the European Commission, multinational telecoms companies and R&D departments of FMCG companies to bring diverse teams together in pursuit of corporate objectives.

33,"Eric Stanley Life Tour @ Suite 36 - New York, NY ","New+York,+NY","Representing the elite genre of classically-trained artists, Eric Stanley is the new face and persona of the young and creative innovators boldly changing the musical landscape by honoring tradition yet embracing the present.
His artistry is inescapable. No matter which genre of music you prefer, his vibe and melodic presence will resonate with you. Eric has been influential in the art of improvisation by remixing popular songs on his violin and fusing Classical, Pop, Jazz, Country, EDM and Hip Hop elements.
Growing up in a musical household, Eric’s mother would play piano while he and his siblings sang along. During one of his family’s jam sessions, Eric’s older brother played a viola which sparked Eric’s interest in playing viola as well. The then 12 year old chose to play violin instead when viola proved to be a challenge due to its size. During his high school years, he received professional training and joined the Richmond Youth Symphony Orchestra.
At the suggestion of his older sister, Eric uploaded videos of himself playing violin covers of his favorite songs in his dorm room to YouTube while attending Virginia Commonwealth University. To Eric’s surprise, his YouTube channel became a hit. The influx of requests for Eric to perform worldwide began and remain constant today.
Awarded YouTube’s Silver Play Button Award in 2015 and the Black Caucus, Black Student Union & NAACP’s Master Of Music Award in 2012, Eric continues to amaze his 130K+ YouTube subscribers and the masses, hence, his 19 million+ YouTube views.
His impressive performance repertoire includes: ESPN’s First Take, International Emmy® Kids Awards, Hennessy’s 250th Celebration, Kimora Lee Simmons’ KLS Spring Summer 2017 NY Fashion Week Show, Televisa’s TVyNovelas Nominee Awards Party, Birth Of A Nation Premiere Reception, ShaggFest, Super Bowl Champ Michael Robinson’s Celebrity Waiter Fundraiser, 9 Mile Music Festival, Senator Kevin S. Parker’s Annual MLK, Jr. Tribute Concert, Richmond Jazz Festival, Nordic eCommerce Summit, TEDxRVA, as well as Elliot Masie’s Learning Conference 2011 in which former President Bill Clinton served as keynote speaker, just to name a few.
This musical prodigy has performed in concert with Machine Gun Kelly, Mr. Cheeks of Lost Boyz fame, and served as an opening act for B.O.B, Wale, J. Cole, Big Daddy Kane, Kid Capri, Chad Hugo, and Hezekiah Walker.
With a worldwide fan base, Eric Stanley is well on his way to achieving his goal of inspiring others with his violin.   ""Trying to be better than someone else is a pure waste of time. Strive to be better than you were yesterday"" - Eric Stanley

Let yourself rise fierce and love great. You will be changed. The very fabric of your Being will be altered by this.If you allow it. Please, Allow it.” ~ Author Unknown

The evening will be a collaboration of two families who are dedicated to preserving the community through their family craft: Andre Prince Jeffries, third generation owner of Prince’s, and Rob and Amy Cartwright, the husband-and-wife team behind Independence Brewing. This event will mark the first time Prince’s Hot Chicken has been served in Texas.

About Prince’s Hot Chicken:Hot chicken is indisputably Nashville's iconic food, and at the food’s center is Prince’s Hot Chicken, a hole-in-the-wall joint on Nashville's north side. By all accounts, Prince's is where hot chicken was born, and the legend goes like this: More than 70 years ago, Thornton Prince came home after a night of tomcatting to find his lady waiting at home, none too pleased. To teach him a lesson, she doctored his Sunday morning chicken with a wallop of spice and coincidentally birthed the now-iconic dish. Prince’s has remained in the family and the family tradition is now continued by Andre Prince Jeffries, great-niece of Thornton Prince. The experience at Prince’s is still as authentic today as it was 70 years ago and led to the restaurant landing on the James Beard America’s Classic list.
About Independence Brewing:Since opening in 2004, Independence Brewing founders Rob and Amy Cartwright have supported all things local, from community involvement with local nonprofits like Austin Pets Alive and the Sustainable Food Center, to their First Saturday events which promote local bands, food vendors and organizations. The Cartwrights continue their passion for producing beers that they not only personally love, but that come from the highest quality ingredients. The award-winning brewery has nabbed top honors for a variety of their brews, including several Good Food Awards and medal placements at the World Beer Cup and the Great American Beer Festival.

INDIVIDUAL BLESSING DAY
Amma will be giving individual blessings in Austin, TX from 11 AM to 5 PM on Friday, April 14 at the Sri Shirdi Sai Baba Temple of Austin, 2509 West New Hope Drive, Cedar Park, Texas 78613 All Individual Blessing programs are free and open to everyone. This is a very special opportunity for you to speak one-on-one with Amma and convey any specific questions, concerns, or blessing requests to her. (Please note: that each person may only receive one individual blessing per yearly tour).
Individual Blessings are a chance for families to come before Amma to receive her gift of profound love and spiritual energy. Amma considers all of creation as her own family and all beings as her very own children. This divine motherly love inspires Amma to tune in directly to the specific requests her children bring to her.
For many people the Individual Blessing is an encounter with the Divine in the form of a human being – a saint, a teacher, a spirutal guide, a loving mother. Great peace and inner silence comes easily in the presence of our beloved Amma.








Timeless moments with Amma are extremely rare. Individuals who receive a blessing with Amma have the opportunity to write down any of their concerns on an index card which Amma will read in their presence. Some people seek her words of wisdom. Some come to her to receive her spiritual touch which awakens the chakras and the higher mind and opens the heart to the path of unconditional love. Amma often blesses people's personal belongings, charging them with spiritual energy. Please bring your children and infants as they are most welcome. 
Amma offers a special blessing, Sarawati Diksha, for students ages four to 24 in which she gives them a special mantra that enhances their memory skills and helps them with their studies. If you are interested, please register for this event when you check in on Blessing Day. While Blessing Day is free to all, Saraswati Diksha follows the ancient Vedic tradition where students offer their teacher a donation. Generally, the event ocurrs around 1:00 pm.
In India, ten of thousands of people show up for Amma's blessings. Don't miss this special, intimate opportunity to spend time in Amma's company.
 
SILENT MEDITATION RETREAT  We cordially invite you to join Amma for a One-Day Meditation Retreat in Houston, on Saturday, April 15 from 8 AM to 6 PM at the Sri Shirdi Sai Baba Temple of Austin. All meditators, from beginners to those with an established practice will benefit from the special retreat atmosphere. The retreat is being offered so that more people can take advantage of this precious time with Amma without disrupting their busy schedules. Participants will be spiritually nourished by Amma's serene presence, silent meditations, discourses, and spiritual chanting. The retreats will provide an invaluable opportunity for devotees to deepen their meditation practice and to listen to the inspirational wisdom of Amma's divine discourses. 
Please register early since these retreats tend to fill up fast. A light vegetarian lunch and snacks will be provided as part of the registration fee. 
HOMA (SACRED FIRE CEREMONY)
  Join Amma to participate in a Homa, a Sacred Fire Ceremony on Sunday, April 16, from 9 AM – 1 PM at the Shirdi Sai Jalaram Mandir. Homa is the most ancient and sacred ceremony in the Vedic tradition of Sanatana Dharma. It is a fire in which forms of the Divine are invoked through the power of mantra and profound spiritual intention. Special offerings are cast into the fire while Sanskrit mantras are chanted, and the combined energy of the fire, offerings, and mantras generates powerful spiritual vibrations that bless and purify everyone present, spreading peace and healing through the world. The smoke that rises from a homa contains a powerful healing energy, and as it rises to the heavens it purifies the atmosphere, both physically and subtly, encouraging a peaceful environment and gentle weather. For more information. We look forward to seeing you there!

If you have any questions please contact the Austin co-ordinator at: Austin@Karunamayi.org. We look forward to a blissful time with Amma basking in her radiant love, taking in her blessings, bhajans and absorbing her Divine grace and wisdom!

As you get more of your calories from healthy fats and cut back on carbs, you’ll start burning fat, losing weight, and feeling strong and energetic—without feeling hungry or deprived.
The Keto Diet does away with the “one size fits all” philosophy offering a customizable approach that is tailored to the unique needs of the individual. Leanne provides the tools to empower everyone to develop a personalized nutrition plan, offering limitless options while taking away the many restrictions of a traditional ketogenic diet.
A one-stop guide to the ketogenic way of eating, The Keto Diet shows you how to transition to and maintain a whole foods–based, paleo-friendly, ketogenic diet with a key focus on practical strategies—and tons of mouthwatering recipes.",2017-04-18,2017-04-20 11:35:48.481872

79,"3hr Beginner's Photography Class (Austin, TX)","Austin,+TX","Become a better photographer and stop using your camera's ""Auto"" mode in 1 evening.
Have you ever wondered why after spending hundreds of dollars on the latest cameras you still can't get photos you're really proud of? We're not talking about the party snapshots you post on Facebook, but stunning landscapes that can be considered fine art and grab attention for longer than 5 seconds.
Learn to capture beautiful photos and never miss a memory again.
This 3 hour class is a crash course in digital photography. Taught in our Austin studio (in groups of 20-25 students), you'll learn what all those knobs and dials on your DSLR do, the settings to use in any lighting condition, and even what kind of camera to buy if you don't already have one. You'll understand concepts like exposure, aperture, depth of field and shutter speed, and probably never want to use the ""automatic mode"" again.
No prior experience or camera equipment is necessary to attend. Just a desire to improve your photography skills. Take this class for yourself or gift it to a friend who's got a photographic itch to scratch. 
Frequently Asked Questions


What's the class schedule? This is a 3 hour class held most Saturdays and Sundays from 10am-1pm. The dates are scheduled approximately 1 month in advance, and more dates are added every few weeks.


What's the format of this class? It's a group class held in an indoor classroom setting in groups of around 20 students.


I already have some photography experience from high school, or just from playing with my camera. Will this class be useful for me? Yes, it could be a good refresher for you to consolidate all the bits and pieces of knowledge you've picked up over the years. You'll also find plenty of inspiration (in the form of some beautiful photos) to get back into photography if you haven't done it in a while. You get to ask any burning questions to a professional photographer. And it's a great way to spend an afternoon in the company of other beginners and amateurs. However, if you already have a good handle on things like shutter speed, aperture, ISO and manual mode, this class is probably going to be too basic for you.


What kind of camera do I need to attend this class? Bring whichever camera you currently own. No need to buy anything special or fancy for this class. We explain the differences between simple point & shoot cameras and DSLRs, so you'll be better informed about what kind of camera to buy, should you decide to upgrade your current one.


What else should I bring to class? Anything you need to take notes on (pen, paper, iPad, laptop etc) and a snack or drink.


Have more questions? Please shoot us an email for a quick response (faster than calling, leaving a voicemail and waiting to hear back).",2017-04-23,2017-04-20 11:35:48.481872

103,"MODULE D, SAN FRANCISCO: SOLUTIONS MARKETING","San+Francisco,+CA","Professor:  Stephen HurleyCourse ID: 8997Course description: 
A wide range of industries and companies, led by technology and professional services firms, have moved aggressively over the last few years to improve their ability to be more customer-centric and provide true solutions to their customer base. Marketers are leading the charge to shift at least a portion of their portfolios from discrete products and services to more integrated, business-oriented solutions. Solutions Marketing: Transforming the Business provides a hands-on immersion in the models, tools, and best practice examples that companies need to market and sell solutions.
Based on a number of new business and marketing models, this course will help students understand and identify what marketers can do to change their companies’ business model. The concept of solutions marketing is a new one – in fact, there is very little written about it in academia.
The course content will be comprised largely of articles, blog posts, and case studies written by Prof. Hurley. The material will provide the students with the latest thinking and techniques that are being applied inside some of the world’s biggest and most influential companies. Companies that will be discussed in detail include GE, DuPont, IBM, Cisco, HP, Infosys, Cognizant. Avaya, and a number of other well-known global companies.

104,"MODULE E, SAN FRANCISCO: MANAGEMENT CONSULTING","San+Francisco,+CA","Professor:  Raymond DerenzoCourse ID: 9104Course description: 
The relentless forces of changing customer needs, globalization, cost containment, de- regulation, and technological change, combined with the drive for sustainable profitable growth, and creating public value, require companies, and public sector organizations, to continually rethink their strategies, operating models, and management systems.
Most organizations reach out to Management Consulting Advisory services to help them figure out the strategies and operational improvements needed to succeed in this turbulent world. The Management Consulting industry has thus been witnessing growth over the past 3 decades, and has become a career of choice for many MBA graduates.
This course is all about understanding the Management Consulting industry, and is primarily designed for those who are interested in pursuing consulting as a career. The course will present the frameworks and approaches used to improve the success rate in realizing organizational strategic goals – it is about the ability to help organizations to improve their performance, and deliver better results for their stakeholders. It is neither about strategy formulation, nor about strategy execution but the link (perhaps the missing link) between the two. It is about developing the analytical skills, and a structured approach to help organizations performance better, and achieve better results. The course also aims to help students understand this industry: the players, the rising stars, growth areas, and the skills needed to join the Management Consulting Firm (or start a new one!).

110,"Agile Coaching For All (ACFA) - San Francisco, CA","San+Francisco,+CA","An Advanced Course for Leaders and Agile Coaches alike.Agile Coaching For All is for leaders and agile coaches who want to exponentially increase their knowledge and ability to lead and empower teams.
Agile Coaching For All brings critical tools, techniques, skills, and ideas from the professional coaching and brain-based training worlds to leaders, managers, agile coaches, and ScrumMasters alike. These roles are constantly challenged to help people, teams, and organizations grow and thrive in a complex world. They need to learn and hone skills that help them benefit from healthy conflict, in order to achieve organizational goals.
Agile and lean methods are targeted at helping us succeed in our increasingly complex world. Leaders, managers, and agile coaches need to bring new and deeper levels of engagement and skill to their roles. Working directly with organizations both large and small, we continue to find that leaders and agile coaches don’t have all the skills they need to productively engage and challenge teams. Simply telling teams to “have courage” and “focus” are comical at best. Teams need to be constantly improving, not just with what they are delivering, but with how they work together as a team, if they are ever going to reach high-performance.
Agile Coaching For All is focused first and foremost on giving you the skills and practice to apply coaching concepts to real business scenarios. Go beyond agile practices and learn skills from the professional coaching and brain-based training to deal with the most common challenge you face, people issues! The class includes opportunity for practice, time for analysis and reflection, learning games, new skills, new tools, new techniques, and ideas you can apply immediately after class!

For Leaders and ManagersPeople are often promoted into leadership roles based on the success they had in the previous role. Unfortunately, the promotion is rarely combined with the training necessary to help people learn how to be an effective leader. Thus, the common pattern that today’s leaders have struggled with is ‘how to create an engaging environment that results in high collaboration, learning, and producing quality results.
This three-day workshop is your opportunity to take your leadership experience to an advanced level — as you discover the benefits of utilizing different coaching approaches. Explore what it means bring yourself to a leadership situation. Effective leadership requires developing several skillsets, including learning how to coach individuals and teams. Leave this highly interactive workshop comprehending that coaching goes beyond ‘agile coaching’ and instead is a powerful dynamic that you can put to use immediately in your own leadership development! Get the training you need for increased success. 
For Agile Coaches and ScrumMastersAgile coach training is a critical part of any agile organizations progress and must go beyond agile practices. Agile Coaches typically transition from other roles in the organization (e.g. ScrumMaster or Project Manager) and find themselves lacking many of the more challenging skills to help teams and the organization succeed. Learn what it really means to be an agile coach and the skills you need to succeed in the position.

Do you have questions about what you are doing and why? If the answer is “yes,’ then this is the right course for you!
Risk management is a defining attribute of the 21st century. Many companies and organizations are going through growing pains attempting to implement effective and sustainable business practices.

Third, this course designed for a wide audience. The course is designed for personnel from all organizations and companies with no prior formal education in risk management required.

In this two-day workshop conference, you will learn strategies for success in your organization.

Understand the difference between acceptable risk-based thinking and significant deviations from the accepted industry practice
Understand how risk management has been implemented in different industry sectors and in different countries around the world
Investigate methods to identify true root causes of problems and to evaluate and prioritize solutions
Implement formal methods for decision-making
Develop successful implementation plans

Massachusetts General Hospital
Boston, MA
April 29 & 30, 2017


Course Description: 
Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) are the primary providers of dysphagia and report spending the majority of their practice managing swallowing disorders in their healthcare settings. However, formal and informal training on normal and impaired swallowing for SLPs is lacking and inconsistent across academic and clinical training domains. Critical thinking in dysphagia management is needed to significantly shift SLP practice patterns. The overall goals of this course are for attendees to leave with the ability to apply objective physiologic metrics, to utilize a clinical decision tree, and to empower attendees with critical talking points to advocate for resources for patients with dysphagia.
 
Course Objectives:
1. Identify inconsistencies in clinical decision making for traditional and emerging treatment techniques.
2. Learn how to apply objective metric based measures to establish a diagnostic baseline and treatment gains in dysphagia management.
3. Derive physiologically based treatments to address several of the most common challenging swallowing pathophysiologies.
4. Learn to create and use a physiologically guided clinical decision tree to incorporate into your everyday practice.

Speaker Bios:
Ianessa A. Humbert, Ph.D., CCC-SLP (left) - Dr. Humbert is an Associate Professor at the University of Florida in the Department of Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences. She has expertise in swallowing and swallowing disorders. Dr. Humbert’s research program is focused on the physiological mechanisms of swallowing disorders and the development of rehabilitation strategies for dysfunction. Her interests center on the peripheral and central control of swallowing in normal and impaired function. More recently, a major interest of her research program has been to understand the neural mechanisms underlying normal and disordered swallowing and how principles of motor learning can be applied to examine these as well as swallowing interventions. In this context, Dr. Humbert’s research involves neural stimulation, neural imaging, and peripheral perturbation studies of swallowing in humans. These studies focus on aspects of age-related decline and neurogenic dysphagia and how rehabilitation can be more effective when implementing skill learning and/or adaptation to perturbations.
Dr. Humbert’s research has been steadily supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health, The American Heart Association, and The American Speech Language Hearing Association since 2006. Dr. Humbert is a widely sought after invited speaker at several regional, national, and international clinical and scientific meetings. Dr. Humbert has created online courses for CEU credit on swallowing physiology and clinical practice, for which hundreds of clinicians have registered to date and she is the author of the Swallowing Pocket Guide: A Quick Reference for Muscles and Innervation, which has sold several hundred copies nationally and internationally.
 
Emily K. Plowman, Ph.D., CCC-SLP (right) - Dr. Emily Plowman is an Associate Professor at the University of Florida where she is jointly appointed in the departments of Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences and Physical Therapy.  She teaches graduate level courses in dysphagia, medical speech-language pathology, upperaerodigestive tract dysfunction and research methodology at USF.  In addition, Dr. Plowman provides clinical services in the department of Neurology for individuals with speech and swallowing dysfunction and is the Chief Speech-Language Pathologist at the USF multidisciplinary amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) clinic.
Dr. Plowman is the Principal Investigator of the Neuromotor Speech and Swallowing Restoration (NSSR) laboratory, which she founded in 2011.   The mission of her lab is to improve and maintain upper aerodigestive tract function in individuals with neurologic disease and the associated processes of speech, breathing and swallowing.  Dr. Plowman and her team aim to accomplish this goal through the provision of expert clinical care, patient education and innovative evidence-based research in both translational animal models and human clinical trials.
Dr. Plowman serves on the Board of Directors for the Dysphagia Research Society, is the co-chair for the Northeast Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (NEALS) Consortium Bulbar Committee, on the NEALS Ventilation Committee, and the Medical Advisor for ‘A Life Story Foundation’ a non-profit ALS patient advocacy group.  She has current National Institute of Health funding to study innovative and physiologically guided treatment strategies for bulbar dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease.

Don’s Certified Agile Leadership workshop is designed to help leaders prepare for what it will take to achieve true organizational agility. Future leaders are welcome to attend. 
 PRE-WORK
Each attendee is assumed to have basic knowledge of Scrum.   To help assure that everyone is on the same page, it is expected that everyone will take some time to review the current 17 page Scrum Guide located at:
http://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2016/2016-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf
It is also assumed that everyone will review the Agile Manifesto and associated Principles prior to the workshop.
http://agilemanifesto.org
http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html
Most importantly, I’d like each of you to spend some time considering the last Agile transformation in which you participated and be prepared to discuss the:

Pre-Existing Situation
Perceived Need for Change
Approach to Transformation
Goal
Outcome

Are you wondering what other small changes you can make to greatly increase your capacity for social change?  Please join Criterion Institute on May 15 in Boston for our newest offering, TOOLKIT for Gender Lens Investing!
TOOLKIT starts the morning of May 15 at 10am with a running leap into finding new ways to look at and think about the social issues you are currently working on. On the surface TOOLKIT is merely a cool set of cards and a facilitated training workshop. Once you get into it you will see the years of development that went into creating elegant and well thought out frameworks and discover the power of the program to help you design for what change you seek through investing in the world.

“TOOLKIT allows us to shift the lens, and question deeply held assumptions about how we do fiduciary responsibility. It is a new narrative about what we can and can’t do in finance.” Ellen Friedman, Executive Director of Compton Foundation

The workshop will run until 4pm (lunch is provided), and will be led by gender lens investing pioneer, Joy Anderson, Founder and President of the Criterion Institute. This is a unique opportunity to not only immerse yourself in gender lens investing, but to do so with one of the people who helped build the field from the beginning. Using TOOLKIT, Joy will serves as your guide to the leading edge of what’s possible at the intersection of gender and finance.
Whether you are a philanthropist looking to incorporate gender lens investing into your portfolio, an investor or an investment manager ready to include more gender analysis into your firm’s financial analysis, an equal pay advocate seeking to learn how to use existing systems of finance to create a more just economy, or a social entrepreneur who wants to learn to ask better questions about gender, this TOOLKIT workshop will have an impact on your work, and the lives of those you are working to for.
You will come away from TOOLKIT with more than a cool set of cards and great stories, you will leave the workshop with new ideas of what’s possible and implementable strategies for how you and your organization can more efficiently and effectively implement your gender lens investment program.

""I joined TOOLKIT with a few years of impact investing experience thinking I knew a thing or two about gender lens investing. The 6 hour workshop proved just how much I had to learn (most importantly that gender lens investing and impact investing are not the same thing!). While it felt like we went in depth into several topics, it never felt over my head. Topics were presented in a very clear manner, and framed in an easy-to-digest format. The group was large enough to ensure diversity among participants, but small enough for a very safe learning and discussion space. I can’t wait to attend a future TOOLKIT workshop.” Karia Young-Eagle, Women's Funding Network

We look forward to seeing you.
The Criterion Team
 

 
More About TOOLKIT:
Throughout the TOOLKIT workshop we will show you five frameworks to help you see where gender might matter in finance. To aid you, you will be given a box of cards and illustrative games that are used throughout the TOOLKIT process.  Each element of the framework will be highlighted by stories from the field and supported by a set of tools that can be applied to your particular context. The five elements of the framework include:
1. Shifting or expanding what enterprises get investments. What does it take to build a pipeline of women-led enterprises or an accelerator with a gender lens? How can we invest directly in the issues we care about to create gender equitable social change?
2. Introducing new data or eliminating bias in financial analysis. Where can data about gender patterns make investments smarter? What are the gender patterns in a geography or an industry that should inform analysis of risk?
3. Addressing power dynamics through shifting structures and the terms of investment.  How are structures themselves gendered? How can terms and even legal documents be used intentionally to shift power in relationships?
4. Changing what processes are trusted or who is seen as expert. What would happen if we had more women at the decision making tables?
5. Changing the goal of the portfolio and the benchmarks by which investments are measured. What if we wanted to bet big on the future of women in our world?  How would we benchmark that?

175,"May 2017 Functional Forum Meetup [Boston, MA]","Boston,+MA","The Evolution of Primary Care
For our May show, the Evolution of Medicine is thrilled to be heading to Minnesota, MN for the first time, the site of the largest Functional Forum meetup to date. So far in 2017, we have focused each episode on medical specialties, where the functional medicine operating system could be beneficial in going upstream and solving the root causes of those disease categories.
Primary Care, however, is where we believe is the rightful place for functional medicine not only for the best clinical outcomes, but also for the positive economic impact for payers and patients alike. During the episode we will not only be looking at the clinical models, but also evolved delivery models including micropractices, membership models and episodes of care.
Furthermore, the Evolution of Primary Care is about all different professions coming together to serve patients on the front lines, helping people create and maintain health. To this end, we'll be featuring a variety of guests from across the professions set to this evolution.
Featured in this episode are leaders in the space who are already bringing functional medicine to the masses. First we welcome, Dr. Thomas Sult who brings decades of experience treating tough cases. He's on the faculty at the Institute for Functional Medicine and will be sharing insight from his clinic ""Third Opinion"".
We are thrilled to welcome Dr. Kristi Hughes for her Functional Forum debut. Dr. Hughes is one of the most popular educators with the Institute for Functional Medicine and has a successful functional medicine practice. She be sharing a mix of clinical and practical pearls about operating a functional medicine practice on the front lines.
We're also very excited to welcome Dr. Sachin Patel of the Living Proof Institute as our other keynote speaker. Dr. Patel is running of one of the most innovative practices functional medicine in North America. His Living Proof Institute is expanding rapidly. Dr. Patel has been innovating the group structure, marketing, and patient acquisition. We're very excited to share his vison of the future of primary care.
Also, joining this group of practitioners is journalist, Pilar Garsimo, founding editor of Experience Life magazine who has been covering the emergence of functional medicine for more than a decade.
Featured Speakers:
Thomas Sult, MD Kristi Hughes, ND Sachin Patel, DC Pilar Gerasimo

 Why attend a meetup?
One of the biggest frustrations we hear from practitioners who practice the type of medicine that you do, is that you feel isolated from the rest of their medical community who don’t “get” the true value of what you offer. The purpose of the Functional Forum local meetup groups is to help you to develop a community of practitioners in your area who “get it”, to build your referral network, add value to your practice, your community, and the movement at large.
Anyone can tune into our Functional Forum event via livestream. What really excites us is when our events create dialogue between practitioners that are sharing best practices, asking tough questions, and helping each other to create the greatest impact with their patients and communities. It gives you the opportunity to not only network but also, keep your finger on the pulse of what’s happening in your own healthcare community.",2017-05-03,2017-04-20 11:35:48.481872
176,"102: Duct Performance Workshop - Boston, MA","Boston,+MA","Why You Should AttendToday, many homeowners experience problems that HVAC equipment cannot solve. A contractor who understands the “House as a System” approach, has a “leg up” on the competition. Participants in this class leave with a better understanding of how problems can be diagnosed and what they can do to repair them. This class covers a great deal of technical information, but attendees will also learn basic lead generating and lead converting techniques.
This three-day intensive technical class focuses on the problems and opportunities created by duct leakage, poor design and installation. In addition, this class covers other duct system challenges: e.g. high static pressure, low air flow, poor insulation, poor terminal selection, closed door pressure imbalances. The participant will have an understanding of airflow, how to design/size and install a duct system, how too properly use a ductulater for sizing and back engineering and why it is important to have a proper size duct.
All attendees will receive a Comfort Institute Duct Performance Certification by completing and receiving a passing grade on our certification exam. All attendees will also have the option to take the Retrotec DTC exam for an additional $75.
What You Will Learn
• Impacts of duct leakage on system efficiency and comfort in layman’s terms 
• Why high efficiency variable speed & 2 stage equipment is most affected by bad ducts
• Impacts of duct leakage on dust, IAQ and combustion safety 
• Why “basement ducts” inside the house still need repair 
• How to present your findings positively as “opportunities” not “problems” 
• Six ways to demonstrate and measure duct leakage compared 
• Manual duct sealing materials and techniques 
• Aeroseal duct sealing process explained 
• How to seal building cavity returns 
• Quality control duct sealing testing-out options compared 
• Impacts of low airflow & poor duct insulation on system efficiency and comfort 
• How to measure and interpret external staticpressure & drop across filters and coils 
• Effects of duct sealing on static pressure and airflow 
• Basics of replacement duct design and common mistakes to avoid
What You Will EarnThis class offers continuing education units (CEUs) for BPI and for NATE. When you provide us with your identification number for either organization, you can receive 12 BPI CEUs and/or 24 NATE CEUs (associated specialties). You can also earn a Comfort Institute Duct Performance Certification designation and/or Retrotec DTC when you receive a passing grade for the exam.",2017-09-11,2017-04-20 11:35:48.481872

For many years, I've listened to requests from therapists during this time and know what clinical pearls you want to learn and common mistakes that happen in the clinic. This Bootcamp is a popular concept for Pelvic Health PTs and is part of the Pelvic Guru Mentoring Program.

FAQs
What is the refund policy?
Refunds are honored up to 30 days before the course and may be subject to up to a 20% administrative fee. Within 30 days until the course, refunds will not be provided, but can be transferred to another individual or used for a similar course (and additional fees added if other courses are higher in price).
If the course does not reach a minimum number of students up to 30 days before the course, the course may be cancelled; and a full refund will be provided.
What are the course hours?
Saturday: Registration at 8:00. Course hours:  8:30 am - 6:00 pm (There will be a 1 hour lunch).
Sunday: Regular course hours 8:00 am - 4:00.
Will I get CEUs or a certificate?
PT/PTA CEUs pending approval. If you are coming in from another state, we can provide you with additional information for CEUs.
Any pre-course work or reading ahead of time?
• Review pelvic anatomy - one resource here:Ultimate Pelvic Anatomy Resource
• Bring any anatomy references if this will be helpful for you.
• Think about your clinical strengths and weakness: What do you hope to learn more about? Any cases you have questions about?
What should I wear and how will labs run?
Wear comfortable course attire. You have the option to participate in labs as a model for partners. We still suggest this so that others have a chance to see many different pelvic floors. However, I create an environment where this is not mandatory. We will likely have models on site as case studies (one male and one female).
What do you recommend for lodging and travel?
From the hosts: Stay tuned for this info!

These educational courses are the very basis for every aesthetics practice.
Overview: The Botox Training workshop is very complete and all inclusive and created so that you can immediately begin performing these techniques on your own. The general format of the workshop is to receive very detailed lectures in the morning followed by intensive hands on training in the afternoon.
The workshop gives you the opportunity to use real Botulinum Toxin products on actual live volunteers. In fact, a good percentage of your tuition is used to purchase these supplies as well as all the medicines you will be using. Attendees are also welcome to bring along a friend or companion if you choose to use them for your injections. (Why not, they are receiving FREE injections. We never charge our volunteers).
Workshop Topics: You will learn all the protocols associated with each of the Botulinum Toxin Type A products such as Botox Cosmetic as well as the newer, highly effective Xeomin and Dysport products. To operate a successful aesthetic practice it is important to know about and be able to utilize the different products your patients may ask for. Each will be available and used during the hands on portion of the class so you can decide on your own which Botulinum product will best suit your practice objectives.

Comprehensive Training and Certification: This is a certification program intended only for Physicians and qualified health care practitioners. After completion of the course and demonstration of proficiency, you will receive your certification and course certificate. Attendees also have the option to receive their certificate framed in an attractive wood and metal plaque.
Empire provides you with everything needed to perform Botox injections safely and correctly in your practice so that you will not only become certified to perform Botox injections, but will also gain a level of confidence working on your own patients. Empire has successfully graduated thousands of medical professionals over the past 17 years and helped many of them set up their own Aesthetic practices as well.

205,"Sclerotherapy Training - Chicago, IL","Chicago,+IL","Improved techniques, new, safer sclerosing agents, and high patient demand for in-office aesthetic procedures makes Sclerotherapy Training for nurses and physicians a must for any physician practice wishing to expand their services. Over 80 million Americans suffer with unsightly venous disease and the vast majority (75%) of these is cosmetic in nature which you will understand and be able to treat after completing our training.
Visible veins give the impression of age and poor health and though many people wish to receive treatment, they are unaware of the safety, effectiveness, and lack of discomfort associated with newer sclerotherapy methods. Sclerotherapy by injection uses small amounts of detergent solutions to irritate the vein walls and achieve ultimate closure of the unwanted vein.  
Cosmetic laser centers and vein clinics perform these procedures not only because they are lucrative and simple to perform, but also because their patients receive impressive results using both laser vein therapies and traditional sclerotherapy using FDA approved detergent sclerosants.  Our comprehensive sclerotherapy training will take you from the prospective patient through the consultation process as well as teach you the latest techniques and protocols used today.

Spend a day with Scott Kelby and take your Lightroom skills to the next level. The entire day is designed to give you the maximum bang for your buck by focusing on the stuff today’s photographers really need to know in Lightroom (and by skipping the fluff you can leave behind). It’s a modern workflow, and way of learning, that will unlock a whole new way of working in Lightroom that you are going to absolutely love!

Here’s what you’ll learn:
10:00AM - 11:15AMReally Getting Your Images Organized in LightroomIf you’re ready to finally get Lightroom set-up the right way—where you can find any image you want, anytime you want, without spending a ton of time entering in keywords—this session is for you! Scott shares his exact step-by-step system to keep everything organized and running at top speed. You’ll be amazed at how a solid, simple system can make all the difference. This is a session that will change everything! He covers everything from backing up to Smart Collections. It’s not a bunch of jargon and theoretical ideas—you’ll learn the exact techniques you’ll use daily in a real-world workflow that works!11:30 – 12:45PMHow to Edit & Tweak Your Images Like a ProScott shares his proven techniques for editing images to get incredible looking results that will take your image to the next level. He takes you step-by-step through the process so you’ll know exactly what to do, in what order, and more importantly why. Once you master the techniques taught in this class you’ll be one step closer to creating the jaw-dropping images you’ve always dreamed of.1:45 - 3:00 PMPhotoshop for Lightroom Users (a kick-butt crash course)Can you learn everything about Photoshop in one hour? Not a chance! But you absolutely can learn just the stuff you need to know in Photoshop that you can’t already do in Lightroom. This is a really eye-opening session. If you’ve ever thought, “Ya know, I really need to start using Photoshop…” this class will blow your mind (mostly, because you’ll find out that as powerful as Photoshop is, with the methods you’ll pick up, learning it is much, much easier than you’d think).3:15 – 4:00 PMLightroom Killer TipsThis is that fast-paced fun session (from the Editor of “LightroomKillerTips.com"" himself) where you learn all those insider tips and tricks to help you work faster, more efficiently, and get twice the work done in half the time. It’s those little known features and time-saving techniques, shortcuts, work-arounds, and just plain hidden stuff that will change the way you work in Lightroom from this day forward. You will be amazed at what you’ll learn in just this one session. 4:15 – 5:00 PMExpanding Lightroom's PowerThere is a lot more to Lightroom than just organizing and editing, and in this session Scott’s going to uncover the techniques and features that unlock Lightroom’s full potential. You’ll learn everything from how to make photo books, to how to create pro-looking print layouts. Plus how to do real client web proofing, how to shoot tethered, which 3rd party plugins to use (and why), and you’ll wrap up learning Scott’s start-to-finish Lightroom workflow. It’s an amazing way to wrap up an incredible day of Lightroom learning from the man who literally wrote the book on using Lightroom. 
Best of all, you’ll have a complete, fully-detailed class workbook that follows right along with Scott’s live training (including a series of videos created just for this tour) so you don’t have to spend the day scribbling notes—instead you can relax, focus and take it all in.

ABOUT THIS SEMINAR
Overlooking emotional problems in the school can lead to grave consequences for students, parents and educators. Many students experience emotional or mental health issues at some point in their academic careers. For some students, these issues can escalate into severe behaviors – behaviors that are harmful to the student and/or to others. Educators are in a unique position to help struggling students while also identifying and preventing the most severe outcomes – bullying, harassment, self-injury, violence and suicide. This seminar will help professional educators identify, reach, teach and/or refer students with serious mental health concerns.
A daunting amount of information is now available about mental health issues. The complexity of much of this information sometimes leads to misunderstandings, tentativeness, and possible mistakes in handling mental health issues with students. The presenter of this seminar will provide straightforward insights, innovative strategies and “how-to-handle” tips for real cases in classrooms and schools. Interpreting mental health behaviors according to intensity, frequency, duration and impact will also be addressed – including what to do when a student has moved into a crisis phase. Participants will develop an understanding of critical mental health issues in a way that will help both educators and students in their classrooms and schools.

Listen to nationally known presenter and author Kaye Randall addressing misconceptions surrounding self-injury in youth.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Want to turn your business into a machine? Want to supercharge your business? Don’t try and design the path alone—come learn from the expert who has already done it at a high level.

Tim Heyl, mega expansion agent, not only shows the destination—he demonstrates the path to get there. If you want success, you need to learn how to behave like a successful agent, and Tim can light that path. 

Content:


Tim Heyl’s Real Estate Machine is a hard-hitting one-day class that walks through the most important aspects of developing your team platform. Tim explores his path from sale #1 to the 7th level, with all the challenges, lessons, tools, systems, and best practices learned along the way.

Topics covered include:
The MREA Models: How to leverage the Organizational, Lead Generation, Economic, and Budget Models for your business
The 7 Levels: The path from solo agent to Expansion Empire explained
Tim’s Story: Tim’s (not so direct) path to success, with all the ups and downs along the way
Top Heyl Group Tools: The systems, scripts, and partners that have fueled Tim’s success




Outcome:
You’ll walk out of REM with the mindset of a builder. You’ll also receive copies of tools that you can integrate into your business today to boost productivity, reduce chaos, and cut through the fog that real estate can produce. Tools include trackers, scripts, forms, checklists, and more. 

Audience:Agents who are on or intend to be on the Millionaire Real Estate Agent path to leverage, desiring to own a business that runs without them. 


TESTIMONIALS:
""I had the pleasure over the weekend to take Tim Heyl's Real Estate Machine in Austin, TX. Wow. Take the class. Tim and his team have created a really simple business blueprint built (say that 3x fast) on the MREA models that is both efficient and detailed - one might even say machine like. They willingly shared these models and openly answered questions without reservation. After #kwmc, I was confident my brain would be overloaded and not able to absorb any more information. I was wrong. At the end of the day I walked away with clear action items for myself and a visibly higher level of energy. Take the class."" - Joe McCue

""Sharing because I honestly had some of the hugest, most tangible, most applicable, most integratabtle, ahas out of this class on Saturday.  Probably more than any other class I have attended all year. And for those of you who know me, know that I've traveled quite a bit! He lays it all out. All the details all his market advantages… All the systems. Tons of tools. Absolutely the most valuable take away from mega camp. That team is one of the most polished I've seen yet and they are so happy to share with everyone in the class to help others succeed. (And I don't say that lightly...)"" - Vanessa Noble

""After two Family Reunions and two BOLDS and having only been in real estate for 13 months I was beyond impressed. Tim's very genuine and pragmatic style of presenting shows a step by step recipe for success for the neophyte or sage agent! His parents did a great job raising him! His simplistic way of describing how to untangle the web of KW after you drink the kool-aid was very refreshing. Step by step how to be successful. The best workshop I have ever been to! After going to his class and taking Bold again for the third time next month I feel I am very grounded to double my last years business which even shocked me at how well I did in 10 months. Tim's class should BE A MUST and not an option for every new agent!""

""Amazing, this is the best value yet for me. Everyone should attend this and save lots of money and efforts by knowing how to implement the models and avoid so many mistakes.""

FAQs
 
Q: Who should attend a Regional Training Academy?
A: Our conference was built to target a wide range of audiences, yet, it is customizable to individualize the experience. Anyone in your department that uses the Emergency Reporting system should attend. This could include, but isn’t limited to: fire marshals, training officers, chief officers, administrative staff, public information officers and upwardly mobile suppression personnel.
""This class should be required by at least one administrator on the ERS system (if not more). Very informative and worth every minute of my time.” — David Richardson, Midwest City Fire Department
 
Q: Do I need to attend all three days of the Regional Training?
A: It is highly recommended by the Emergency Reporting Training staff and past attendees to attend all three days. Day 1 covers the Essentials, but Day 2 and Day 3 dig into specific challenges your department is facing with records management. There are so many valuable, time-saving aspects of the system that it requires three days to cover comprehensively. Although we offer options to attend only the first two days, the best experience is by attending all three days.
 
Q: Who teaches at the Regional Training?
A: Emergency Reporting Trainers are active or recently retired firefighters with over 100 years combined firefighting experience. Before they were Emergency Reporting Trainers, they were Emergency Reporting Customers. Our Trainers fully understand your needs because, like you, they have spent years answering the call for help. Now they are ready to help you get the most out of Emergency Reporting.

A: We will provide a delicious lunch on the first day of class, as well as coffee, snacks, and refreshments each day throughout the conference. Wi-Fi will also be provided.
 
Q: What should I bring to the Training?
A: Make sure to bring a Wi-Fi enabled device so you can access your Emergency Reporting account. If you use a tablet, be sure to bring that too. Most people will bring a mobile device, electronic chargers, something to take notes with, and patches to exchange with other fire departments.

Q: Do you have any hotel discounts? 
Discounted rooms are available. You will recieve an email with the instructions to get your discounted rooms. 
Q: Is there any required dress attire?
A: Yes, business casual is recommended. Duty uniforms are fine, but certainly not required. We want you to be comfortable during the conference experience.

240,"May 2017 Functional Forum Meetup [Chicago, IL]","Chicago,+IL","The event will start at 6:30PM with a light healthy dinner. We will have a brief introduction to the evening including a short presentation related to this month's topic prior to joining the telecast of the Functional Forum live at 7PM. The telecast typically lasts approximately 60-90 minutes.
The Evolution of Primary Care
For our May show, the Evolution of Medicine is thrilled to be heading to Minnesota, MN for the first time, the site of the largest Functional Forum meetup to date. So far in 2017, we have focused each episode on medical specialties, where the functional medicine operating system could be beneficial in going upstream and solving the root causes of those disease categories.
Primary Care, however, is where we believe is the rightful place for functional medicine not only for the best clinical outcomes, but also for the positive economic impact for payers and patients alike. During the episode we will not only be looking at the clinical models, but also evolved delivery models including micropractices, membership models and episodes of care.
Furthermore, the Evolution of Primary Care is about all different professions coming together to serve patients on the front lines, helping people create and maintain health. To this end, we'll be featuring a variety of guests from across the professions set to this evolution.
Featured in this episode are leaders in the space who are already bringing functional medicine to the masses. First we welcome, Dr. Thomas Sult who brings decades of experience treating tough cases. He's on the faculty at the Institute for Functional Medicine and will be sharing insight from his clinic ""Third Opinion"".
We are thrilled to welcome Dr. Kristi Hughes for her Functional Forum debut. Dr. Hughes is one of the most popular educators with the Institute for Functional Medicine and has a successful functional medicine practice. She be sharing a mix of clinical and practical pearls about operating a functional medicine practice on the front lines.
We're also very excited to welcome Dr. Sachin Patel of the Living Proof Institute as our other keynote speaker. Dr. Patel is running of one of the most innovative practices functional medicine in North America. His Living Proof Institute is expanding rapidly. Dr. Patel has been innovating the group structure, marketing, and patient acquisition. We're very excited to share his vison of the future of primary care.
Also, joining this group of practitioners is journalist, Pilar Garsimo, founding editor of Experience Life magazine who has been covering the emergence of functional medicine for more than a decade.
Featured Speakers:
Thomas Sult, MD Kristi Hughes, ND Sachin Patel, DC Pilar Gerasimo

 Why attend a meetup?
One of the biggest frustrations we hear from practitioners who practice the type of medicine that you do, is that you feel isolated from the rest of their medical community who don’t “get” the true value of what you offer. The purpose of the Functional Forum local meetup groups is to help you to develop a community of practitioners in your area who “get it”, to build your referral network, add value to your practice, your community, and the movement at large.
Anyone can tune into our Functional Forum event via livestream. What really excites us is when our events create dialogue between practitioners that are sharing best practices, asking tough questions, and helping each other to create the greatest impact with their patients and communities. It gives you the opportunity to not only network but also, keep your finger on the pulse of what’s happening in your own healthcare community.

La base de todas las terapias es la intención de ayudar; Y a través de la estimulación del sistema nervioso por medio de un masaje con suaves toques a la columna vertebral trasmitir una intención, una emoción que logra la Regeneración Celular.
En Expresión Celular cualquier padecimiento, malestar, enfermedad o dolor es tratado directamente, ademas se reorganiza la energia metabolica mediante la estimulacion con suaves toques en centros energéticos del cuerpo promoviendo con ella la optima función energética del organismo y un estado de bienestar integral y sensación de paz.

303,"Eric Stanley Life Tour @ Suite 36 - New York, NY ","New+York,+NY","Representing the elite genre of classically-trained artists, Eric Stanley is the new face and persona of the young and creative innovators boldly changing the musical landscape by honoring tradition yet embracing the present.
His artistry is inescapable. No matter which genre of music you prefer, his vibe and melodic presence will resonate with you. Eric has been influential in the art of improvisation by remixing popular songs on his violin and fusing Classical, Pop, Jazz, Country, EDM and Hip Hop elements.
Growing up in a musical household, Eric’s mother would play piano while he and his siblings sang along. During one of his family’s jam sessions, Eric’s older brother played a viola which sparked Eric’s interest in playing viola as well. The then 12 year old chose to play violin instead when viola proved to be a challenge due to its size. During his high school years, he received professional training and joined the Richmond Youth Symphony Orchestra.
At the suggestion of his older sister, Eric uploaded videos of himself playing violin covers of his favorite songs in his dorm room to YouTube while attending Virginia Commonwealth University. To Eric’s surprise, his YouTube channel became a hit. The influx of requests for Eric to perform worldwide began and remain constant today.
Awarded YouTube’s Silver Play Button Award in 2015 and the Black Caucus, Black Student Union & NAACP’s Master Of Music Award in 2012, Eric continues to amaze his 130K+ YouTube subscribers and the masses, hence, his 19 million+ YouTube views.
His impressive performance repertoire includes: ESPN’s First Take, International Emmy® Kids Awards, Hennessy’s 250th Celebration, Kimora Lee Simmons’ KLS Spring Summer 2017 NY Fashion Week Show, Televisa’s TVyNovelas Nominee Awards Party, Birth Of A Nation Premiere Reception, ShaggFest, Super Bowl Champ Michael Robinson’s Celebrity Waiter Fundraiser, 9 Mile Music Festival, Senator Kevin S. Parker’s Annual MLK, Jr. Tribute Concert, Richmond Jazz Festival, Nordic eCommerce Summit, TEDxRVA, as well as Elliot Masie’s Learning Conference 2011 in which former President Bill Clinton served as keynote speaker, just to name a few.
This musical prodigy has performed in concert with Machine Gun Kelly, Mr. Cheeks of Lost Boyz fame, and served as an opening act for B.O.B, Wale, J. Cole, Big Daddy Kane, Kid Capri, Chad Hugo, and Hezekiah Walker.
With a worldwide fan base, Eric Stanley is well on his way to achieving his goal of inspiring others with his violin.   ""Trying to be better than someone else is a pure waste of time. Strive to be better than you were yesterday"" - Eric Stanley

306,"Sclerotherapy Training - New York, NY","New+York,+NY","Improved techniques, new, safer sclerosing agents, and high patient demand for in-office aesthetic procedures makes Sclerotherapy Training for nurses and physicians a must for any physician practice wishing to expand their services. Over 80 million Americans suffer with unsightly venous disease and the vast majority (75%) of these is cosmetic in nature which you will understand and be able to treat after completing our training.
Visible veins give the impression of age and poor health and though many people wish to receive treatment, they are unaware of the safety, effectiveness, and lack of discomfort associated with newer sclerotherapy methods. Sclerotherapy by injection uses small amounts of detergent solutions to irritate the vein walls and achieve ultimate closure of the unwanted vein.  
Cosmetic laser centers and vein clinics perform these procedures not only because they are lucrative and simple to perform, but also because their patients receive impressive results using both laser vein therapies and traditional sclerotherapy using FDA approved detergent sclerosants.  Our comprehensive sclerotherapy training will take you from the prospective patient through the consultation process as well as teach you the latest techniques and protocols used today.

311,"Reconciling Biomechanics with Pain Science - New York, NY","New+York,+NY","Course Description
At its simplest, this is a BIOMECHANICS and PAIN SCIENCE course.  Ideally, we've distilled the best of both to get the best approach to pain and injury management.
Reconciling Biomechanics with Pain Science is a two-day course that mixes a lecture, case study and hands-on learning format. This course has been taught throughout the world with the aim of simplifying the biomechanical approach to injury and pain management.  A simplified, yet strongly evidenced based biomechanical approach, allows the therapist to develop skills that address all areas of the biopsychosocial contributors to the pain experience.  This course teaches When Biomechanics Matters and fits this approach into Therapeutic Neuroscience Education framework.
Traditional rehabilitation practice is steeped in the biomedical model of treating pain and injuries.  While the biopyschosocial model of care is touted as being the superior approach it is often difficult to incorporate traditional biomechanical training within this model.  There is the fear that therapists become psychotherapists.  The aim of this course is to help reconcile and reconceptualize the biomechanical approach.  You will learn that you need not throw the baby out with the bath water when you embrace the biopsychosocial (BPS) approach.  Remember, the BPS model starts with ""Bio"": you will learn how biomechanics matters and how pain science education and cognition changing can fit together.
This course is great for anyone working with people in pain or injuries.  Physiotherapists, Chiros, Massage Therapists , Osteopaths, Sport Therapists, Movement Pros/Teachers and Strength Coaches are welcome.

The Evolution of Primary Care
For our May show, the Evolution of Medicine is thrilled to be heading to Minnesota, MN for the first time, the site of the largest Functional Forum meetup to date. So far in 2017, we have focused each episode on medical specialties, where the functional medicine operating system could be beneficial in going upstream and solving the root causes of those disease categories.
Primary Care, however, is where we believe is the rightful place for functional medicine not only for the best clinical outcomes, but also for the positive economic impact for payers and patients alike. During the episode we will not only be looking at the clinical models, but also evolved delivery models including micropractices, membership models and episodes of care.
Furthermore, the Evolution of Primary Care is about all different professions coming together to serve patients on the front lines, helping people create and maintain health. To this end, we'll be featuring a variety of guests from across the professions set to this evolution.
Featured in this episode are leaders in the space who are already bringing functional medicine to the masses. First we welcome, Dr. Thomas Sult who brings decades of experience treating tough cases. He's on the faculty at the Institute for Functional Medicine and will be sharing insight from his clinic ""Third Opinion"".
We are thrilled to welcome Dr. Kristi Hughes for her Functional Forum debut. Dr. Hughes is one of the most popular educators with the Institute for Functional Medicine and has a successful functional medicine practice. She be sharing a mix of clinical and practical pearls about operating a functional medicine practice on the front lines.
We're also very excited to welcome Dr. Sachin Patel of the Living Proof Institute as our other keynote speaker. Dr. Patel is running of one of the most innovative practices functional medicine in North America. His Living Proof Institute is expanding rapidly. Dr. Patel has been innovating the group structure, marketing, and patient acquisition. We're very excited to share his vison of the future of primary care.
Also, joining this group of practitioners is journalist, Pilar Garsimo, founding editor of Experience Life magazine who has been covering the emergence of functional medicine for more than a decade.
Featured Speakers:
Thomas Sult, MD Kristi Hughes, ND Sachin Patel, DC Pilar Gerasimo

 Why attend a meetup?
One of the biggest frustrations we hear from practitioners who practice the type of medicine that you do, is that you feel isolated from the rest of their medical community who don’t “get” the true value of what you offer. The purpose of the Functional Forum local meetup groups is to help you to develop a community of practitioners in your area who “get it”, to build your referral network, add value to your practice, your community, and the movement at large.
Anyone can tune into our Functional Forum event via livestream. What really excites us is when our events create dialogue between practitioners that are sharing best practices, asking tough questions, and helping each other to create the greatest impact with their patients and communities. It gives you the opportunity to not only network but also, keep your finger on the pulse of what’s happening in your own healthcare community.

322,"Cynefin & Complexity Foundations - New York City, NY","New+York,+NY","In today’s increasingly volatile and uncertain world, there is a need  for new ways of making sense of current situations and managing in new and rapidly shifting contexts. Our past practices and approaches are failing us and what had worked reliably during more stable times in the past is unfortunately proving inadequate for the dynamic present. This course challenges the deeply rooted thinking patterns that have been ingrained by years of conventional thinking.
Take a dive into complexity theory, and the practical implications for operating in a world of inherent uncertainty.  Learn about the Cynefin framework – and how to apply it in organisations; how to make better decisions, dependent on the situation; cognitive neuroscience – and how it can shape how we build and communicate in organisations.

What it’s about:
Complexity has become a buzzword for the world we work within - this course provides you with the foundational tools to understand what it means to act and manage in complexity.
Cynefin and Complexity Foundations forms the core component of Cognitive Edge's training offerings. It contributes to building the basic scaffolds around which further anthro-complexity (also referred to as “cognitive complexity”) approaches and concepts are constructed, and form a key sense-making toolkit for working in complex environments. 

Who it is for:
This course designed for people who work in constantly-evolving, dynamic situations, dealing daily with uncertainty and risk, and looking for a enhanced compass for building organisations that are both resilient and innovative. Whether you work in an organisation navigating intractable problems, or are a consultant looking to include complexity principles into your practice - or if you are simply complexity-curious - this Foundations class is for you.

What we will cover:
This has been designed as a 3-day session - a combination of deep immersion into Anthro-complexity, and introduction to working with the Cynefin framework, to complete the Foundations level sessions.
The session will begin with an introduction to complexity, and the natural and human science that sit behind the naturalising tradition of anthro-complexity. Discover and manage the evolutionary potential of the present by increasing situational awareness of the types of systems that we sit within, and how to modulate within complex systems.
The Cynefin framework has subtleties and nuances which are not easily accessible to the casual reader. Building on the basics of anthro-complexity, and the Harvard Business Review article, the third day goes deeper into the uses of the framework, accompanied by facilitated workshop activities and tools that have been used in organisations as diverse as the European Commission, multinational telecoms companies and R&D departments of FMCG companies to bring diverse teams together in pursuit of corporate objectives.

By all accounts, Prince's is where hot chicken was born, and the legend goes like this: More than 70 years ago, Thornton Prince came home after a night of tomcatting to find his lady waiting at home, none too pleased. To teach him a lesson, she doctored his Sunday morning chicken with a wallop of spice and coincidentally birthed the now-iconic dish. Prince’s has remained in the family and the family tradition is now continued by Andre Prince Jeffries, great-niece of Thornton Prince. The experience at Prince’s is still as authentic today as it was 70 years ago and led to the restaurant landing on the James Beard America’s Classic list.
About Independence Brewing:Since opening in 2004, Independence Brewing founders Rob and Amy Cartwright have supported all things local, from community involvement with local nonprofits like Austin Pets Alive and the Sustainable Food Center, to their First Saturday events which promote local bands, food vendors and organizations. The Cartwrights continue their passion for producing beers that they not only personally love, but that come from the highest quality ingredients. The award-winning brewery has nabbed top honors for a variety of their brews, including several Good Food Awards and medal placements at the World Beer Cup and the Great American Beer Festival.

INDIVIDUAL BLESSING DAY
Amma will be giving individual blessings in Austin, TX from 11 AM to 5 PM on Friday, April 14 at the Sri Shirdi Sai Baba Temple of Austin, 2509 West New Hope Drive, Cedar Park, Texas 78613 All Individual Blessing programs are free and open to everyone. This is a very special opportunity for you to speak one-on-one with Amma and convey any specific questions, concerns, or blessing requests to her. (Please note: that each person may only receive one individual blessing per yearly tour).
Individual Blessings are a chance for families to come before Amma to receive her gift of profound love and spiritual energy. Amma considers all of creation as her own family and all beings as her very own children. This divine motherly love inspires Amma to tune in directly to the specific requests her children bring to her.
For many people the Individual Blessing is an encounter with the Divine in the form of a human being – a saint, a teacher, a spirutal guide, a loving mother. Great peace and inner silence comes easily in the presence of our beloved Amma.








Timeless moments with Amma are extremely rare. Individuals who receive a blessing with Amma have the opportunity to write down any of their concerns on an index card which Amma will read in their presence. Some people seek her words of wisdom. Some come to her to receive her spiritual touch which awakens the chakras and the higher mind and opens the heart to the path of unconditional love. Amma often blesses people's personal belongings, charging them with spiritual energy. Please bring your children and infants as they are most welcome. 
Amma offers a special blessing, Sarawati Diksha, for students ages four to 24 in which she gives them a special mantra that enhances their memory skills and helps them with their studies. If you are interested, please register for this event when you check in on Blessing Day. While Blessing Day is free to all, Saraswati Diksha follows the ancient Vedic tradition where students offer their teacher a donation. Generally, the event ocurrs around 1:00 pm.
In India, ten of thousands of people show up for Amma's blessings. Don't miss this special, intimate opportunity to spend time in Amma's company.
 
SILENT MEDITATION RETREAT  We cordially invite you to join Amma for a One-Day Meditation Retreat in Houston, on Saturday, April 15 from 8 AM to 6 PM at the Sri Shirdi Sai Baba Temple of Austin. All meditators, from beginners to those with an established practice will benefit from the special retreat atmosphere. The retreat is being offered so that more people can take advantage of this precious time with Amma without disrupting their busy schedules. Participants will be spiritually nourished by Amma's serene presence, silent meditations, discourses, and spiritual chanting. The retreats will provide an invaluable opportunity for devotees to deepen their meditation practice and to listen to the inspirational wisdom of Amma's divine discourses. 
Please register early since these retreats tend to fill up fast. A light vegetarian lunch and snacks will be provided as part of the registration fee. 
HOMA (SACRED FIRE CEREMONY)
  Join Amma to participate in a Homa, a Sacred Fire Ceremony on Sunday, April 16, from 9 AM – 1 PM at the Shirdi Sai Jalaram Mandir. Homa is the most ancient and sacred ceremony in the Vedic tradition of Sanatana Dharma. It is a fire in which forms of the Divine are invoked through the power of mantra and profound spiritual intention. Special offerings are cast into the fire while Sanskrit mantras are chanted, and the combined energy of the fire, offerings, and mantras generates powerful spiritual vibrations that bless and purify everyone present, spreading peace and healing through the world. The smoke that rises from a homa contains a powerful healing energy, and as it rises to the heavens it purifies the atmosphere, both physically and subtly, encouraging a peaceful environment and gentle weather. For more information. We look forward to seeing you there!

If you have any questions please contact the Austin co-ordinator at: Austin@Karunamayi.org. We look forward to a blissful time with Amma basking in her radiant love, taking in her blessings, bhajans and absorbing her Divine grace and wisdom!

More about the book…
The Keto Diet: The Complete Guide to a High-Fat Diet brings an entirely new approach to achieving health, healing, weight loss, and happiness through a keto-adapted lifestyle.
For too long we’ve blamed dietary fat for weight gain and health problems. The truth is, a diet that’s high in natural, healthy fats can actually help your body burn fat! That’s the secret behind the ketogenic diet. As you get more of your calories from healthy fats and cut back on carbs, you’ll start burning fat, losing weight, and feeling strong and energetic—without feeling hungry or deprived.
The Keto Diet does away with the “one size fits all” philosophy offering a customizable approach that is tailored to the unique needs of the individual. Leanne provides the tools to empower everyone to develop a personalized nutrition plan, offering limitless options while taking away the many restrictions of a traditional ketogenic diet.
A one-stop guide to the ketogenic way of eating, The Keto Diet shows you how to transition to and maintain a whole foods–based, paleo-friendly, ketogenic diet with a key focus on practical strategies—and tons of mouthwatering recipes.",2017-04-18,2017-04-20 11:35:48.481872

372,"3hr Beginner's Photography Class (Austin, TX)","Austin,+TX","Become a better photographer and stop using your camera's ""Auto"" mode in 1 evening.
Have you ever wondered why after spending hundreds of dollars on the latest cameras you still can't get photos you're really proud of? We're not talking about the party snapshots you post on Facebook, but stunning landscapes that can be considered fine art and grab attention for longer than 5 seconds.
Learn to capture beautiful photos and never miss a memory again.
This 3 hour class is a crash course in digital photography. Taught in our Austin studio (in groups of 20-25 students), you'll learn what all those knobs and dials on your DSLR do, the settings to use in any lighting condition, and even what kind of camera to buy if you don't already have one. You'll understand concepts like exposure, aperture, depth of field and shutter speed, and probably never want to use the ""automatic mode"" again.
No prior experience or camera equipment is necessary to attend. Just a desire to improve your photography skills. Take this class for yourself or gift it to a friend who's got a photographic itch to scratch. 
Frequently Asked Questions


What's the class schedule? This is a 3 hour class held most Saturdays and Sundays from 10am-1pm. The dates are scheduled approximately 1 month in advance, and more dates are added every few weeks.


What's the format of this class? It's a group class held in an indoor classroom setting in groups of around 20 students.


I already have some photography experience from high school, or just from playing with my camera. Will this class be useful for me? Yes, it could be a good refresher for you to consolidate all the bits and pieces of knowledge you've picked up over the years. You'll also find plenty of inspiration (in the form of some beautiful photos) to get back into photography if you haven't done it in a while. You get to ask any burning questions to a professional photographer. And it's a great way to spend an afternoon in the company of other beginners and amateurs. However, if you already have a good handle on things like shutter speed, aperture, ISO and manual mode, this class is probably going to be too basic for you.


What kind of camera do I need to attend this class? Bring whichever camera you currently own. No need to buy anything special or fancy for this class. We explain the differences between simple point & shoot cameras and DSLRs, so you'll be better informed about what kind of camera to buy, should you decide to upgrade your current one.


What else should I bring to class? Anything you need to take notes on (pen, paper, iPad, laptop etc) and a snack or drink.


Have more questions? Please shoot us an email for a quick response (faster than calling, leaving a voicemail and waiting to hear back).",2017-04-23,2017-04-20 11:35:48.481872

Solutions Marketing: Transforming the Business provides a hands-on immersion in the models, tools, and best practice examples that companies need to market and sell solutions.
Based on a number of new business and marketing models, this course will help students understand and identify what marketers can do to change their companies’ business model. The concept of solutions marketing is a new one – in fact, there is very little written about it in academia.
The course content will be comprised largely of articles, blog posts, and case studies written by Prof. Hurley. The material will provide the students with the latest thinking and techniques that are being applied inside some of the world’s biggest and most influential companies. Companies that will be discussed in detail include GE, DuPont, IBM, Cisco, HP, Infosys, Cognizant. Avaya, and a number of other well-known global companies.

396,"MODULE E, SAN FRANCISCO: MANAGEMENT CONSULTING","San+Francisco,+CA","Professor:  Raymond DerenzoCourse ID: 9104Course description: 
The relentless forces of changing customer needs, globalization, cost containment, de- regulation, and technological change, combined with the drive for sustainable profitable growth, and creating public value, require companies, and public sector organizations, to continually rethink their strategies, operating models, and management systems.
Most organizations reach out to Management Consulting Advisory services to help them figure out the strategies and operational improvements needed to succeed in this turbulent world. The Management Consulting industry has thus been witnessing growth over the past 3 decades, and has become a career of choice for many MBA graduates.
This course is all about understanding the Management Consulting industry, and is primarily designed for those who are interested in pursuing consulting as a career. The course will present the frameworks and approaches used to improve the success rate in realizing organizational strategic goals – it is about the ability to help organizations to improve their performance, and deliver better results for their stakeholders. It is neither about strategy formulation, nor about strategy execution but the link (perhaps the missing link) between the two. It is about developing the analytical skills, and a structured approach to help organizations performance better, and achieve better results. The course also aims to help students understand this industry: the players, the rising stars, growth areas, and the skills needed to join the Management Consulting Firm (or start a new one!).

403,"Agile Coaching For All (ACFA) - San Francisco, CA","San+Francisco,+CA","An Advanced Course for Leaders and Agile Coaches alike.Agile Coaching For All is for leaders and agile coaches who want to exponentially increase their knowledge and ability to lead and empower teams.
Agile Coaching For All brings critical tools, techniques, skills, and ideas from the professional coaching and brain-based training worlds to leaders, managers, agile coaches, and ScrumMasters alike. These roles are constantly challenged to help people, teams, and organizations grow and thrive in a complex world. They need to learn and hone skills that help them benefit from healthy conflict, in order to achieve organizational goals.
Agile and lean methods are targeted at helping us succeed in our increasingly complex world. Leaders, managers, and agile coaches need to bring new and deeper levels of engagement and skill to their roles. Working directly with organizations both large and small, we continue to find that leaders and agile coaches don’t have all the skills they need to productively engage and challenge teams. Simply telling teams to “have courage” and “focus” are comical at best. Teams need to be constantly improving, not just with what they are delivering, but with how they work together as a team, if they are ever going to reach high-performance.
Agile Coaching For All is focused first and foremost on giving you the skills and practice to apply coaching concepts to real business scenarios. Go beyond agile practices and learn skills from the professional coaching and brain-based training to deal with the most common challenge you face, people issues! The class includes opportunity for practice, time for analysis and reflection, learning games, new skills, new tools, new techniques, and ideas you can apply immediately after class!

For Leaders and ManagersPeople are often promoted into leadership roles based on the success they had in the previous role. Unfortunately, the promotion is rarely combined with the training necessary to help people learn how to be an effective leader. Thus, the common pattern that today’s leaders have struggled with is ‘how to create an engaging environment that results in high collaboration, learning, and producing quality results.
This three-day workshop is your opportunity to take your leadership experience to an advanced level — as you discover the benefits of utilizing different coaching approaches. Explore what it means bring yourself to a leadership situation. Effective leadership requires developing several skillsets, including learning how to coach individuals and teams. Leave this highly interactive workshop comprehending that coaching goes beyond ‘agile coaching’ and instead is a powerful dynamic that you can put to use immediately in your own leadership development! Get the training you need for increased success. 
For Agile Coaches and ScrumMastersAgile coach training is a critical part of any agile organizations progress and must go beyond agile practices. Agile Coaches typically transition from other roles in the organization (e.g. ScrumMaster or Project Manager) and find themselves lacking many of the more challenging skills to help teams and the organization succeed. Learn what it really means to be an agile coach and the skills you need to succeed in the position. Learn how to deal with challenges such as helping the team embrace healthy conflict and dealing with organizational impediments.
This three-day workshop is your opportunity to shift to a new level of coaching and interaction with the leaders, managers, individuals, and teams engage with. Explore what it means to bring yourself — to coach and lead from a place that is authentic to you! Get the training you need to advance as an agile coach and help teams reach high performance. 
What to Expect
Expect in-depth topics and exploration. Expect to be challenged. Expect to learn by interacting with other learners, by practicing, and by stretching your limits. Expect to have fun. To achieve these goals, we use:

Brain-based training to dramatically increase learning and retention
Fun to increase safety and retention (both instructors are Training From the Back of the Room Certified Trainers)
Exercises, exercises, and more exercises – If you are looking for a dry lecture, this class is NOT for you
Interactive and experiential learning

Today’s organizations need to empower people to compete. This means that we need to improve ourselves to meet the demands of today’s complex world. We no longer have the luxury of trying to “know everything” — there is simply too much going on. Instead we need empowered teams and organizations with the opportunity to be creating and innovation to deliver success.Learning Objectives

Understand the difference between acceptable risk-based thinking and significant deviations from the accepted industry practice
Understand how risk management has been implemented in different industry sectors and in different countries around the world
Investigate methods to identify true root causes of problems and to evaluate and prioritize solutions
Implement formal methods for decision-making
Develop successful implementation plans

Massachusetts General Hospital
Boston, MA
April 29 & 30, 2017


Course Description: 
Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) are the primary providers of dysphagia and report spending the majority of their practice managing swallowing disorders in their healthcare settings. However, formal and informal training on normal and impaired swallowing for SLPs is lacking and inconsistent across academic and clinical training domains. Critical thinking in dysphagia management is needed to significantly shift SLP practice patterns. The overall goals of this course are for attendees to leave with the ability to apply objective physiologic metrics, to utilize a clinical decision tree, and to empower attendees with critical talking points to advocate for resources for patients with dysphagia.
 
Course Objectives:
1. Identify inconsistencies in clinical decision making for traditional and emerging treatment techniques.
2. Learn how to apply objective metric based measures to establish a diagnostic baseline and treatment gains in dysphagia management.
3. Derive physiologically based treatments to address several of the most common challenging swallowing pathophysiologies.
4. Learn to create and use a physiologically guided clinical decision tree to incorporate into your everyday practice.

Speaker Bios:
Ianessa A. Humbert, Ph.D., CCC-SLP (left) - Dr. Humbert is an Associate Professor at the University of Florida in the Department of Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences. She has expertise in swallowing and swallowing disorders. Dr. Humbert’s research program is focused on the physiological mechanisms of swallowing disorders and the development of rehabilitation strategies for dysfunction. Her interests center on the peripheral and central control of swallowing in normal and impaired function. More recently, a major interest of her research program has been to understand the neural mechanisms underlying normal and disordered swallowing and how principles of motor learning can be applied to examine these as well as swallowing interventions. In this context, Dr. Humbert’s research involves neural stimulation, neural imaging, and peripheral perturbation studies of swallowing in humans. These studies focus on aspects of age-related decline and neurogenic dysphagia and how rehabilitation can be more effective when implementing skill learning and/or adaptation to perturbations.
Dr. Humbert’s research has been steadily supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health, The American Heart Association, and The American Speech Language Hearing Association since 2006. Dr. Humbert is a widely sought after invited speaker at several regional, national, and international clinical and scientific meetings. Dr. Humbert has created online courses for CEU credit on swallowing physiology and clinical practice, for which hundreds of clinicians have registered to date and she is the author of the Swallowing Pocket Guide: A Quick Reference for Muscles and Innervation, which has sold several hundred copies nationally and internationally.
 
Emily K. Plowman, Ph.D., CCC-SLP (right) - Dr. Emily Plowman is an Associate Professor at the University of Florida where she is jointly appointed in the departments of Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences and Physical Therapy.  She teaches graduate level courses in dysphagia, medical speech-language pathology, upperaerodigestive tract dysfunction and research methodology at USF.  In addition, Dr. Plowman provides clinical services in the department of Neurology for individuals with speech and swallowing dysfunction and is the Chief Speech-Language Pathologist at the USF multidisciplinary amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) clinic.
Dr. Plowman is the Principal Investigator of the Neuromotor Speech and Swallowing Restoration (NSSR) laboratory, which she founded in 2011.   The mission of her lab is to improve and maintain upper aerodigestive tract function in individuals with neurologic disease and the associated processes of speech, breathing and swallowing.  Dr. Plowman and her team aim to accomplish this goal through the provision of expert clinical care, patient education and innovative evidence-based research in both translational animal models and human clinical trials.
Dr. Plowman serves on the Board of Directors for the Dysphagia Research Society, is the co-chair for the Northeast Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (NEALS) Consortium Bulbar Committee, on the NEALS Ventilation Committee, and the Medical Advisor for ‘A Life Story Foundation’ a non-profit ALS patient advocacy group.  She has current National Institute of Health funding to study innovative and physiologically guided treatment strategies for bulbar dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease.

458,"TOOLKIT for Gender Lens Investing - Boston, MA","Boston,+MA","Are you ready to up your gender lens investing game? Are you interested in gender lens investing but don’t know where to start? Are you wondering what other small changes you can make to greatly increase your capacity for social change?  Please join Criterion Institute on May 15 in Boston for our newest offering, TOOLKIT for Gender Lens Investing!
TOOLKIT starts the morning of May 15 at 10am with a running leap into finding new ways to look at and think about the social issues you are currently working on. On the surface TOOLKIT is merely a cool set of cards and a facilitated training workshop. Once you get into it you will see the years of development that went into creating elegant and well thought out frameworks and discover the power of the program to help you design for what change you seek through investing in the world.

“TOOLKIT allows us to shift the lens, and question deeply held assumptions about how we do fiduciary responsibility. It is a new narrative about what we can and can’t do in finance.” Ellen Friedman, Executive Director of Compton Foundation

The workshop will run until 4pm (lunch is provided), and will be led by gender lens investing pioneer, Joy Anderson, Founder and President of the Criterion Institute. This is a unique opportunity to not only immerse yourself in gender lens investing, but to do so with one of the people who helped build the field from the beginning. Using TOOLKIT, Joy will serves as your guide to the leading edge of what’s possible at the intersection of gender and finance.
Whether you are a philanthropist looking to incorporate gender lens investing into your portfolio, an investor or an investment manager ready to include more gender analysis into your firm’s financial analysis, an equal pay advocate seeking to learn how to use existing systems of finance to create a more just economy, or a social entrepreneur who wants to learn to ask better questions about gender, this TOOLKIT workshop will have an impact on your work, and the lives of those you are working to for.
You will come away from TOOLKIT with more than a cool set of cards and great stories, you will leave the workshop with new ideas of what’s possible and implementable strategies for how you and your organization can more efficiently and effectively implement your gender lens investment program.

""I joined TOOLKIT with a few years of impact investing experience thinking I knew a thing or two about gender lens investing. The 6 hour workshop proved just how much I had to learn (most importantly that gender lens investing and impact investing are not the same thing!). While it felt like we went in depth into several topics, it never felt over my head. Topics were presented in a very clear manner, and framed in an easy-to-digest format. The group was large enough to ensure diversity among participants, but small enough for a very safe learning and discussion space. I can’t wait to attend a future TOOLKIT workshop.” Karia Young-Eagle, Women's Funding Network

We look forward to seeing you.
The Criterion Team
 

 
More About TOOLKIT:
Throughout the TOOLKIT workshop we will show you five frameworks to help you see where gender might matter in finance. To aid you, you will be given a box of cards and illustrative games that are used throughout the TOOLKIT process.  Each element of the framework will be highlighted by stories from the field and supported by a set of tools that can be applied to your particular context. The five elements of the framework include:
1. Shifting or expanding what enterprises get investments. What does it take to build a pipeline of women-led enterprises or an accelerator with a gender lens? How can we invest directly in the issues we care about to create gender equitable social change?
2. Introducing new data or eliminating bias in financial analysis. Where can data about gender patterns make investments smarter? What are the gender patterns in a geography or an industry that should inform analysis of risk?
3. Addressing power dynamics through shifting structures and the terms of investment.  How are structures themselves gendered? How can terms and even legal documents be used intentionally to shift power in relationships?
4. Changing what processes are trusted or who is seen as expert. What would happen if we had more women at the decision making tables?
5. Changing the goal of the portfolio and the benchmarks by which investments are measured. What if we wanted to bet big on the future of women in our world?  How would we benchmark that?
Please RSVP Now
Please note the ticket transfer and refund policy: Your payment of $299 guarantees your seat at the TOOLKIT workshop. If something changes after registration and you cannot attend your ticket will be reimbursed in the form of a credit good for a future TOOLKIT workshop of equal or lesser value. To transfer your registration to another attendee please inform the organizers at least 24 hours in advance.  


Criterion is a 15yr old nonprofit think tank that works with social change-makers to demystify finance and broaden their perspective on how to engage with, and shift financial systems.  Criterion does this through a methodology and set of practices that move leaders beyond understanding finance to believing in their own ability use financial systems to advance the social change we seek. Criterion is working towards a future where the power of our financial systems is widely used for social good.

466,"May 2017 Functional Forum Meetup [Boston, MA]","Boston,+MA","The Evolution of Primary Care
For our May show, the Evolution of Medicine is thrilled to be heading to Minnesota, MN for the first time, the site of the largest Functional Forum meetup to date. So far in 2017, we have focused each episode on medical specialties, where the functional medicine operating system could be beneficial in going upstream and solving the root causes of those disease categories.
Primary Care, however, is where we believe is the rightful place for functional medicine not only for the best clinical outcomes, but also for the positive economic impact for payers and patients alike. During the episode we will not only be looking at the clinical models, but also evolved delivery models including micropractices, membership models and episodes of care.
Furthermore, the Evolution of Primary Care is about all different professions coming together to serve patients on the front lines, helping people create and maintain health. To this end, we'll be featuring a variety of guests from across the professions set to this evolution.
Featured in this episode are leaders in the space who are already bringing functional medicine to the masses. First we welcome, Dr. Thomas Sult who brings decades of experience treating tough cases. He's on the faculty at the Institute for Functional Medicine and will be sharing insight from his clinic ""Third Opinion"".
We are thrilled to welcome Dr. Kristi Hughes for her Functional Forum debut. Dr. Hughes is one of the most popular educators with the Institute for Functional Medicine and has a successful functional medicine practice. She be sharing a mix of clinical and practical pearls about operating a functional medicine practice on the front lines.
We're also very excited to welcome Dr. Sachin Patel of the Living Proof Institute as our other keynote speaker. Dr. Patel is running of one of the most innovative practices functional medicine in North America. His Living Proof Institute is expanding rapidly. Dr. Patel has been innovating the group structure, marketing, and patient acquisition. We're very excited to share his vison of the future of primary care.
Also, joining this group of practitioners is journalist, Pilar Garsimo, founding editor of Experience Life magazine who has been covering the emergence of functional medicine for more than a decade.
Featured Speakers:
Thomas Sult, MD Kristi Hughes, ND Sachin Patel, DC Pilar Gerasimo

 Why attend a meetup?
One of the biggest frustrations we hear from practitioners who practice the type of medicine that you do, is that you feel isolated from the rest of their medical community who don’t “get” the true value of what you offer. The purpose of the Functional Forum local meetup groups is to help you to develop a community of practitioners in your area who “get it”, to build your referral network, add value to your practice, your community, and the movement at large.
Anyone can tune into our Functional Forum event via livestream. What really excites us is when our events create dialogue between practitioners that are sharing best practices, asking tough questions, and helping each other to create the greatest impact with their patients and communities. It gives you the opportunity to not only network but also, keep your finger on the pulse of what’s happening in your own healthcare community.",2017-05-03,2017-04-20 11:35:48.481872

What You Will Learn
• Impacts of duct leakage on system efficiency and comfort in layman’s terms 
• Why high efficiency variable speed & 2 stage equipment is most affected by bad ducts
• Impacts of duct leakage on dust, IAQ and combustion safety 
• Why “basement ducts” inside the house still need repair

FAQs
What is the refund policy?
Refunds are honored up to 30 days before the course and may be subject to up to a 20% administrative fee. Within 30 days until the course, refunds will not be provided, but can be transferred to another individual or used for a similar course (and additional fees added if other courses are higher in price).
If the course does not reach a minimum number of students up to 30 days before the course, the course may be cancelled; and a full refund will be provided.

Sunday: Regular course hours 8:00 am - 4:00.
Will I get CEUs or a certificate?
PT/PTA CEUs pending approval. If you are coming in from another state, we can provide you with additional information for CEUs.
Any pre-course work or reading ahead of time?
• Review pelvic anatomy - one resource here:Ultimate Pelvic Anatomy Resource
• Bring any anatomy references if this will be helpful for you.
• Think about your clinical strengths and weakness: What do you hope to learn more about? Any cases you have questions about?
What should I wear and how will labs run?
Wear comfortable course attire. You have the option to participate in labs as a model for partners. We still suggest this so that others have a chance to see many different pelvic floors. However, I create an environment where this is not mandatory. We will likely have models on site as case studies (one male and one female).
What do you recommend for lodging and travel?
From the hosts: Stay tuned for this info!

493,"Botox Training - Chicago, IL","Chicago,+IL","Learn to perform Botox injections and other aesthetic procedures during Empire Medical Training's weekend training programs. For your convenience, we have scheduled the Complete Botox Training, the Dermal Filler and Facial Aesthetics workshops on consecutive days over a weekend. These educational courses are the very basis for every aesthetics practice.
Overview: The Botox Training workshop is very complete and all inclusive and created so that you can immediately begin performing these techniques on your own. The general format of the workshop is to receive very detailed lectures in the morning followed by intensive hands on training in the afternoon.
The workshop gives you the opportunity to use real Botulinum Toxin products on actual live volunteers. In fact, a good percentage of your tuition is used to purchase these supplies as well as all the medicines you will be using. Attendees are also welcome to bring along a friend or companion if you choose to use them for your injections. (Why not, they are receiving FREE injections. We never charge our volunteers).
Workshop Topics: You will learn all the protocols associated with each of the Botulinum Toxin Type A products such as Botox Cosmetic as well as the newer, highly effective Xeomin and Dysport products. To operate a successful aesthetic practice it is important to know about and be able to utilize the different products your patients may ask for. Each will be available and used during the hands on portion of the class so you can decide on your own which Botulinum product will best suit your practice objectives.

Comprehensive Training and Certification: This is a certification program intended only for Physicians and qualified health care practitioners. After completion of the course and demonstration of proficiency, you will receive your certification and course certificate. Attendees also have the option to receive their certificate framed in an attractive wood and metal plaque.
Empire provides you with everything needed to perform Botox injections safely and correctly in your practice so that you will not only become certified to perform Botox injections, but will also gain a level of confidence working on your own patients. Empire has successfully graduated thousands of medical professionals over the past 17 years and helped many of them set up their own Aesthetic practices as well.

495,"Sclerotherapy Training - Chicago, IL","Chicago,+IL","Improved techniques, new, safer sclerosing agents, and high patient demand for in-office aesthetic procedures makes Sclerotherapy Training for nurses and physicians a must for any physician practice wishing to expand their services. Over 80 million Americans suffer with unsightly venous disease and the vast majority (75%) of these is cosmetic in nature which you will understand and be able to treat after completing our training.
Visible veins give the impression of age and poor health and though many people wish to receive treatment, they are unaware of the safety, effectiveness, and lack of discomfort associated with newer sclerotherapy methods. Sclerotherapy by injection uses small amounts of detergent solutions to irritate the vein walls and achieve ultimate closure of the unwanted vein.  
Cosmetic laser centers and vein clinics perform these procedures not only because they are lucrative and simple to perform, but also because their patients receive impressive results using both laser vein therapies and traditional sclerotherapy using FDA approved detergent sclerosants.  Our comprehensive sclerotherapy training will take you from the prospective patient through the consultation process as well as teach you the latest techniques and protocols used today.

Spend a day with Scott Kelby and take your Lightroom skills to the next level. The entire day is designed to give you the maximum bang for your buck by focusing on the stuff today’s photographers really need to know in Lightroom (and by skipping the fluff you can leave behind). It’s a modern workflow, and way of learning, that will unlock a whole new way of working in Lightroom that you are going to absolutely love!

Here’s what you’ll learn:
10:00AM - 11:15AMReally Getting Your Images Organized in LightroomIf you’re ready to finally get Lightroom set-up the right way—where you can find any image you want, anytime you want, without spending a ton of time entering in keywords—this session is for you! Scott shares his exact step-by-step system to keep everything organized and running at top speed. You’ll be amazed at how a solid, simple system can make all the difference. This is a session that will change everything! He covers everything from backing up to Smart Collections. It’s not a bunch of jargon and theoretical ideas—you’ll learn the exact techniques you’ll use daily in a real-world workflow that works!11:30 – 12:45PMHow to Edit & Tweak Your Images Like a ProScott shares his proven techniques for editing images to get incredible looking results that will take your image to the next level. He takes you step-by-step through the process so you’ll know exactly what to do, in what order, and more importantly why. Once you master the techniques taught in this class you’ll be one step closer to creating the jaw-dropping images you’ve always dreamed of.1:45 - 3:00 PMPhotoshop for Lightroom Users (a kick-butt crash course)Can you learn everything about Photoshop in one hour? Not a chance! But you absolutely can learn just the stuff you need to know in Photoshop that you can’t already do in Lightroom. This is a really eye-opening session. If you’ve ever thought, “Ya know, I really need to start using Photoshop…” this class will blow your mind (mostly, because you’ll find out that as powerful as Photoshop is, with the methods you’ll pick up, learning it is much, much easier than you’d think).3:15 – 4:00 PMLightroom Killer TipsThis is that fast-paced fun session (from the Editor of “LightroomKillerTips.com"" himself) where you learn all those insider tips and tricks to help you work faster, more efficiently, and get twice the work done in half the time. It’s those little known features and time-saving techniques, shortcuts, work-arounds, and just plain hidden stuff that will change the way you work in Lightroom from this day forward. You will be amazed at what you’ll learn in just this one session. 4:15 – 5:00 PMExpanding Lightroom's PowerThere is a lot more to Lightroom than just organizing and editing, and in this session Scott’s going to uncover the techniques and features that unlock Lightroom’s full potential. You’ll learn everything from how to make photo books, to how to create pro-looking print layouts. Plus how to do real client web proofing, how to shoot tethered, which 3rd party plugins to use (and why), and you’ll wrap up learning Scott’s start-to-finish Lightroom workflow. It’s an amazing way to wrap up an incredible day of Lightroom learning from the man who literally wrote the book on using Lightroom. 
Best of all, you’ll have a complete, fully-detailed class workbook that follows right along with Scott’s live training (including a series of videos created just for this tour) so you don’t have to spend the day scribbling notes—instead you can relax, focus and take it all in.

ABOUT THIS SEMINAR
Overlooking emotional problems in the school can lead to grave consequences for students, parents and educators. Many students experience emotional or mental health issues at some point in their academic careers. For some students, these issues can escalate into severe behaviors – behaviors that are harmful to the student and/or to others. Educators are in a unique position to help struggling students while also identifying and preventing the most severe outcomes – bullying, harassment, self-injury, violence and suicide. This seminar will help professional educators identify, reach, teach and/or refer students with serious mental health concerns.
A daunting amount of information is now available about mental health issues. The complexity of much of this information sometimes leads to misunderstandings, tentativeness, and possible mistakes in handling mental health issues with students. The presenter of this seminar will provide straightforward insights, innovative strategies and “how-to-handle” tips for real cases in classrooms and schools. Interpreting mental health behaviors according to intensity, frequency, duration and impact will also be addressed – including what to do when a student has moved into a crisis phase. Participants will develop an understanding of critical mental health issues in a way that will help both educators and students in their classrooms and schools.

Listen to nationally known presenter and author Kaye Randall addressing misconceptions surrounding self-injury in youth.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Want to turn your business into a machine? Want to supercharge your business? Don’t try and design the path alone—come learn from the expert who has already done it at a high level.

Tim Heyl, mega expansion agent, not only shows the destination—he demonstrates the path to get there. If you want success, you need to learn how to behave like a successful agent, and Tim can light that path. 

Content:


Tim Heyl’s Real Estate Machine is a hard-hitting one-day class that walks through the most important aspects of developing your team platform. Tim explores his path from sale #1 to the 7th level, with all the challenges, lessons, tools, systems, and best practices learned along the way.

Topics covered include:
The MREA Models: How to leverage the Organizational, Lead Generation, Economic, and Budget Models for your business
The 7 Levels: The path from solo agent to Expansion Empire explained
Tim’s Story: Tim’s (not so direct) path to success, with all the ups and downs along the way
Top Heyl Group Tools: The systems, scripts, and partners that have fueled Tim’s success




Outcome:
You’ll walk out of REM with the mindset of a builder. You’ll also receive copies of tools that you can integrate into your business today to boost productivity, reduce chaos, and cut through the fog that real estate can produce. Tools include trackers, scripts, forms, checklists, and more. 

Audience:Agents who are on or intend to be on the Millionaire Real Estate Agent path to leverage, desiring to own a business that runs without them. 


TESTIMONIALS:
""I had the pleasure over the weekend to take Tim Heyl's Real Estate Machine in Austin, TX. Wow. Take the class. Tim and his team have created a really simple business blueprint built (say that 3x fast) on the MREA models that is both efficient and detailed - one might even say machine like. They willingly shared these models and openly answered questions without reservation. After #kwmc, I was confident my brain would be overloaded and not able to absorb any more information. I was wrong. At the end of the day I walked away with clear action items for myself and a visibly higher level of energy. Take the class."" - Joe McCue

""Sharing because I honestly had some of the hugest, most tangible, most applicable, most integratabtle, ahas out of this class on Saturday.  Probably more than any other class I have attended all year. And for those of you who know me, know that I've traveled quite a bit! He lays it all out. All the details all his market advantages… All the systems. Tons of tools. Absolutely the most valuable take away from mega camp. That team is one of the most polished I've seen yet and they are so happy to share with everyone in the class to help others succeed. (And I don't say that lightly...)"" - Vanessa Noble

""After two Family Reunions and two BOLDS and having only been in real estate for 13 months I was beyond impressed. Tim's very genuine and pragmatic style of presenting shows a step by step recipe for success for the neophyte or sage agent! His parents did a great job raising him! His simplistic way of describing how to untangle the web of KW after you drink the kool-aid was very refreshing. Step by step how to be successful. The best workshop I have ever been to! After going to his class and taking Bold again for the third time next month I feel I am very grounded to double my last years business which even shocked me at how well I did in 10 months. Tim's class should BE A MUST and not an option for every new agent!""

""Amazing, this is the best value yet for me. Everyone should attend this and save lots of money and efforts by knowing how to implement the models and avoid so many mistakes.""

528,"May 2017 Functional Forum Meetup [Chicago, IL]","Chicago,+IL","The event will start at 6:30PM with a light healthy dinner. We will have a brief introduction to the evening including a short presentation related to this month's topic prior to joining the telecast of the Functional Forum live at 7PM. The telecast typically lasts approximately 60-90 minutes.
The Evolution of Primary Care
For our May show, the Evolution of Medicine is thrilled to be heading to Minnesota, MN for the first time, the site of the largest Functional Forum meetup to date. So far in 2017, we have focused each episode on medical specialties, where the functional medicine operating system could be beneficial in going upstream and solving the root causes of those disease categories.
Primary Care, however, is where we believe is the rightful place for functional medicine not only for the best clinical outcomes, but also for the positive economic impact for payers and patients alike. During the episode we will not only be looking at the clinical models, but also evolved delivery models including micropractices, membership models and episodes of care.
Furthermore, the Evolution of Primary Care is about all different professions coming together to serve patients on the front lines, helping people create and maintain health. To this end, we'll be featuring a variety of guests from across the professions set to this evolution.
Featured in this episode are leaders in the space who are already bringing functional medicine to the masses. First we welcome, Dr. Thomas Sult who brings decades of experience treating tough cases. He's on the faculty at the Institute for Functional Medicine and will be sharing insight from his clinic ""Third Opinion"".
We are thrilled to welcome Dr. Kristi Hughes for her Functional Forum debut. Dr. Hughes is one of the most popular educators with the Institute for Functional Medicine and has a successful functional medicine practice. She be sharing a mix of clinical and practical pearls about operating a functional medicine practice on the front lines.
We're also very excited to welcome Dr. Sachin Patel of the Living Proof Institute as our other keynote speaker. Dr. Patel is running of one of the most innovative practices functional medicine in North America. His Living Proof Institute is expanding rapidly. Dr. Patel has been innovating the group structure, marketing, and patient acquisition. We're very excited to share his vison of the future of primary care.
Also, joining this group of practitioners is journalist, Pilar Garsimo, founding editor of Experience Life magazine who has been covering the emergence of functional medicine for more than a decade.
Featured Speakers:
Thomas Sult, MD Kristi Hughes, ND Sachin Patel, DC Pilar Gerasimo

 Why attend a meetup?
One of the biggest frustrations we hear from practitioners who practice the type of medicine that you do, is that you feel isolated from the rest of their medical community who don’t “get” the true value of what you offer. The purpose of the Functional Forum local meetup groups is to help you to develop a community of practitioners in your area who “get it”, to build your referral network, add value to your practice, your community, and the movement at large.
Anyone can tune into our Functional Forum event via livestream. What really excites us is when our events create dialogue between practitioners that are sharing best practices, asking tough questions, and helping each other to create the greatest impact with their patients and communities. It gives you the opportunity to not only network but also, keep your finger on the pulse of what’s happening in your own healthcare community.

FAQs
 
Q: Who should attend a Regional Training Academy?
A: Our conference was built to target a wide range of audiences, yet, it is customizable to individualize the experience. Anyone in your department that uses the Emergency Reporting system should attend. This could include, but isn’t limited to: fire marshals, training officers, chief officers, administrative staff, public information officers and upwardly mobile suppression personnel.
""This class should be required by at least one administrator on the ERS system (if not more). Very informative and worth every minute of my time.” — David Richardson, Midwest City Fire Department
 
Q: Do I need to attend all three days of the Regional Training?
A: It is highly recommended by the Emergency Reporting Training staff and past attendees to attend all three days. Day 1 covers the Essentials, but Day 2 and Day 3 dig into specific challenges your department is facing with records management. There are so many valuable, time-saving aspects of the system that it requires three days to cover comprehensively. Although we offer options to attend only the first two days, the best experience is by attending all three days.
 
Q: Who teaches at the Regional Training?
A: Emergency Reporting Trainers are active or recently retired firefighters with over 100 years combined firefighting experience. Before they were Emergency Reporting Trainers, they were Emergency Reporting Customers. Our Trainers fully understand your needs because, like you, they have spent years answering the call for help. Now they are ready to help you get the most out of Emergency Reporting.

A: We will provide a delicious lunch on the first day of class, as well as coffee, snacks, and refreshments each day throughout the conference. Wi-Fi will also be provided.
 
Q: What should I bring to the Training?
A: Make sure to bring a Wi-Fi enabled device so you can access your Emergency Reporting account. If you use a tablet, be sure to bring that too. Most people will bring a mobile device, electronic chargers, something to take notes with, and patches to exchange with other fire departments.

Q: Do you have any hotel discounts? 
Discounted rooms are available. You will recieve an email with the instructions to get your discounted rooms. 
Q: Is there any required dress attire?
A: Yes, business casual is recommended. Duty uniforms are fine, but certainly not required. We want you to be comfortable during the conference experience.
